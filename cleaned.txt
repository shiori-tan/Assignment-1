rustle wind pool ripple wave
reeds rattle teacups would change tinkle
bell queen shrill cry voice shepherd
boy sneeze baby shriek gryphon
thy queer noise would change know
confuse clamour busy low
cattle distance would take place mock turtle
heavy sob
lastly picture little sister
would grow woman
would keep riper years simple
love heart childhood would gather
little children make eye bright eager
many strange tale perhaps even dream
wonderland long ago would feel
simple sorrow find pleasure simple joy
remember happy summer days
